### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.


Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?” Generated Ideas:
•	Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance.
•	Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures.
•	Energy usage optimization by automating the switching of machines on/off based on demand.
•	Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and control of machinery.

Persona and Context Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?” Generated Context:
•	The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.
•	The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training required for operators.


### Algorithm:

## **Procedure**  

### Step 1 – Define the Scenario & Use Case  
- System aims to reduce manual tracking by automating equipment via IoT devices.  
- Goal: predictive maintenance, improved energy use, and better efficiency.  

***

### Step 2 – Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect  

#### **1. Idea Generation Prompts** (Unit-2 type applied in industrial use case)  
**Prompt:**  
*"What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?"*  

**Generated Ideas:**  
- Install **sensors** for real-time performance monitoring.  
- Provide **predictive maintenance alerts** to prevent failures.  
- Automate **energy consumption optimization** (smart switching).  
- Enable **cloud-based dashboards** for remote monitoring/control.  

***

#### **2. Persona & Context Prompts**  
**Prompt:**  
*"What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?"*  

**Generated Context:**  
- UI must be **intuitive**, showing machine status, alerts & energy usage.  
- System conveys **reliability and simplicity**, requiring **minimal operator training**.  
- Provides **hierarchical views**: operators see machine states, managers see analytics and reports.  

***

#### **3. Comparative Analysis Prompt**  
**Objective:** Compare different automation strategies.  
**Prompt:**  
*"Compare predictive maintenance with traditional preventive maintenance in terms of cost, downtime, and efficiency."*  

**Expected Output:**  
- Predictive → Higher initial cost but significant long-term savings. Detect failures before breakdown → reduces unplanned downtime.  
- Preventive → Scheduled maintenance even if unnecessary, leading to wasted resources.  

***

#### **4. Universal Prompt**  
**Objective:** Use generalized prompts applicable across industries.  
**Prompt:**  
*"List core components of any intelligent automation system for real-time operations."*  

**Expected Output:**  
- IoT-enabled devices and sensors.  
- Cloud/edge analytics engines.  
- Control dashboards + mobile app.  
- Alert/notification system.  

***

#### **5. Structured Prompt Refinements**  
**Objective:** Break down responses for clarity.  
**Prompt:**  
*"Explain predictive maintenance in steps."*  

**Refined Output:**  
1. Sensors collect machine data (temperature, vibration, energy).  
2. Data analyzed via ML models.  
3. Early signs of wear/failure detected.  
4. System alerts operator before breakdown.  

***

#### **6. Prompt Size Limitations**  
**Objective:** Enforce concise outputs.  
**Prompt:**  
*"Describe predictive maintenance in under 40 words."*
